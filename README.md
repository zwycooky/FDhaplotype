# FDhaplotype
This repository contains scripts for the analysis of the FDDB haplotype assembly.

# Workflow
1.  SVdetection: Scripts for identifying structural variations (SVs) between the two haplotypes of the FDDB genome.

2. gap_filling: Scripts for filling gaps in the FDDB genome using additional assemblies.

3. reads_phasing: Scripts for generating haplotype-specific k-mers for the FDDB genome.

4. Phasing_by_FDDB_offspring: Scripts for phasing SNPs using FDDB offspring

5. QTLmapping_in_halfsib_population: Scripts for QTL detection in FDDB half-sib population
